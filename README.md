# DHCP-1
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol for assigning dynamic IP addresses to devices on a network. With this dynamic addressing, a device can have a different IP address every time it connects to the network. In some systems, the device's IP address can even change while it is still connected. DHCP is also used to configure the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information on the device.
